## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. Issues resolved are:
* LICENSE file now contains only YEAR and COPYRIGHT HOLDER fields
* New, smaller examples added for several functions; examples previously wrapped in \dontrun{} are now either unwrapped (if small), or in the cases where execution would likely take >5s they are wrapped in \donttest{}

## Test environments
* Local Windows installation, R 3.4.3
* Ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.4.2
* Win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs. 

## Additional notes
This is the first release of this package to CRAN. (In fact it is the author's first submission of any sort to CRAN.)
